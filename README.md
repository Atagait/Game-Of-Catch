# Game-Of-Catch
A repository for examples of 'A Memory Intensive Game of Try And Catch' in different languages.

The rules of A Memory Intensive Game of Catch (Game of Catch, or GoC from here on out):
1: No user-defined functions may use a return statement
2: User-defined Functions must throw their intended output as an exception.

Schrodinger's Pitch:
3: All member variables of classes must be private.
4: No user-defined methods may return or throw a member variable.
5: Methods may return information **ABOUT** a member variable, but not the value itself.
6: Returning the value of a member variable must cause the containing class to self-destruct afterwards.
